in sys.c i have made a system call shtaskinfo

with the help of finfgetpid  i extracted the pid from the hash table
To find the task_struct of a process we can make use of the function pid_task
 made a file name taskfile that can write read

 made several buffer to separately save the pid information
 used printk to save to print on the kernel
